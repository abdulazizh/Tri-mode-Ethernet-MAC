Tri-mode Ethernet MAC
---------------------

This EDK project is based on the tutorial by FPGA Developer:

http://www.fpgadeveloper.com/2008/10/tri-mode-ethernet-mac.html

It instantiates the embedded Tri-mode Ethernet MAC of the 
Virtex-5 and loops back the output.

You are free to use this code in your own designs, but please 
acknowledge my work by leaving a link to the website. Thanks.
